title: "Abstraction as Bread and Butter"
tags: [mathematics]

<p>
  First pages of a book are the most instructive for many
  reasons. When I look back in a book which I've read many years ago,
  I still find the first pages more interesting and inspiring.

  Recently, I started reading a new book: "A Book of Abstract
  Algebra". Similarly, I found a very interesting statement in the
  introductory chapter:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Algebra at the more advanced level is often described
    as <em>modern</em> or <em>abstract</em> algebra. In fact, both of
    these descriptions are partly misleading. [...] To what extent is
    it <em>abstract</em>? Well, abstraction is all relative; one
    person's abstraction is another person's bread and butter.

  It <em>is</em>, indeed. Obviously, there is a lot to think on the
  abstraction of abstraction.
