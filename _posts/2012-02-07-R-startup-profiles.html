<p>
  It is a useful practice to customize the initialization
  of <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a>. This is achieved
  through <code>R_PROFILE</code> (system wide)
  and <code>R_PROFILE_USER</code> (user specific) files which are both
  simple R scripts.
</p>

<p>
  <code>R_PROFILE</code> is an environment variable, and by default,
  set to <code>${R_HOME}/etc/Rprofile.site</code>. If such a file
  exists, it is evaluated in the global environment of your R session.
</p>

<p>
  Per-user customization is achieved through
  the <code>R_PROFILE_USER</code> environment
  variable. After <code>R_PROFILE</code> has been evaluated, the file
  which is pointed by <code>R_PROFILE_USER</code> is
  evaluated. If <code>R_PROFILE_USER</code> is not set, a file
  named <code>.Rprofile</code> is searched first in the current
  directory, then in the user home directory. If found, it is
  evaluated in the global environment of your R session.
</p>

<p>
  R documentation gives quite a good overview of the entire
  initialization process of an R session. It is recommended to read
  this (through <code>?.Rprofile</code>) since it gives some useful
  hints and warnings as well.
</p>

<p>
  I am keeping my own <code>.Rprofile</code> in my home
  directory. Here is the gist of it:
