  <a
  href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192221.How_to_Solve_It">"How
  to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method"</a> by <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P%C3%B3lya">George
  Pólya</a> provides a detailed and entertaining survey of general
  methods for problem solving, namely the <em>Heuristics</em>. I guess
  that most people dealing with mathematics in daily life have read
  this book.

  Recently, I was very excited when I came across with <a
  href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/633240.How_to_Solve_It">"How
  to Solve It: Modern Heuristics"</a>. This book, like its
  <em>predecessor</em>, is about problem solving, but it focuses on
  computational methodologies to problem solving. There are many
  beautiful comments on the book around the Internet. Although its
  name implies that Pólya's concept of heuristic is traditional and
  this book introduces a modern one, I think that both are modern in
  essence and complement each other from a daily practitioner's point
  of view (I'd name the book as "How to Solve It: Contemporary
  Heuristics" or "How to Solve It: Computational
  Heuristics"). Anyways, it will be a lot fun to read it.

  I am especially delighted when I read the introductory chapter.
  Below is a quote from <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw">George
  Bernard Shaw</a> which is given at the beginning of the very first
  chapter:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable
    one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore
    all progress depends on the unreasonable man.
  </p>

  An interesting man: George Bernard Shaw. I like his humour; it is
  provocative, yet gentle. When I read his views on Islam and the
  transcript of the meeting of him with Maulana Abdul Aleem Siddiqui,
  I was so sad about why I was not introduced to him before. Maybe, I
  should have read "How to Solve It: Modern Heuristics" before.

  Well, it is not too late to read both...
