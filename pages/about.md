These (web) pages here are presenting some *silly* thoughts of mine on
matters which I have to deal with daily. Don't take them too
seriously, yet you can <a href="#license">freely</a> take them away.

Having warned you, here is a little bit of background of myself for
you to filter and perceive my thoughts in accordance with.

My name is Vehbi Sinan Tunalioglu. I was born in Turkey into a lovely
family, grown up in Izmir, lived in Istanbul, Singapore and India
respectively. Currently, I am living in Singapore with my lovely wife,
[Marlynna](http://www.marlynnat.com). We like travelling and
experiencing different *lifes*.

I studied business administration, computer science, international
finance and organization studies. For my passion and living, I
lectured computer science, researched on statistical computing and
political economy, co-founded and partnered at start-ups.

I have symphaty for all kinds of advocacy, no matter of what
motivation, as long as it does not involve and/or result in oppression
of any kind and degree.

Last but not least, I do not have any facebook account, but still have
friends. Very good ones, indeed...
