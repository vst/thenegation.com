    These (web) pages here are presenting some <em>silly</em> thoughts
    of mine on matters which I have to deal with daily. Don't take
    them too seriously, yet you can <a href="#license">freely</a> take
    them away.
  </p>

  <p>
    Having warned you, here is a little bit of background of myself for
    you to filter and perceive my thoughts in accordance with.
  </p>

  <p>
    My name is Vehbi Sinan Tunalioglu. I was born in Turkey into a
    lovely family, grown up in Izmir, lived in Istanbul, Singapore and
    India respectively. Currently, I am living somewhere <em>in
      between</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I studied business administration, computer science, international
    finance and organization studies. For my passion and living, I
    lectured computer science, researched on statistical computing and
    political economy, co-founded and partnered at start-ups.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have symphaty for all kinds of advocacy, no matter of what
    motivation, as long as it does not involve and/or result in
    oppression of any kind and degree.
  </p>

  <p>
    Last but not least, I do not have any facebook account, but still
    have friends. Very good ones, indeed...
