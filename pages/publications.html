      <h1>Portfolio Construction with Asymmetric MGARCH Models: A Comparison of Methods</h1>
    </header>

    <p>
      It is well-known that the joint behaviour of stock markets and
      the crude oil market can be captured best by asymmetric
      conditional correlation models, allowing for asymmetric
      volatility spillovers between these markets. Our study
      investigates practical consequences of these facts for investors
      seeking a combination of stocks and commodities in their
      portfolios. We adopt a global minimum-variance portfolio
      approach, which is characterized by a minimization of risk,
      where we assume that no risk-free asset is available. The only
      input required for constructing a sequence of such portfolios is
      a series of updated correlation forecasts of asset returns. We
      use several MGARCH models, some of which are asymmetric and new,
      to obtain the latter. The portfolios constructed in the way
      outlined are rated with respect to the return they yield, using
      an unconditional correlation approach as benchmark. One of our
      findings is that returns can be increased substantially by
      taking asymmetry explicitly into consideration when forecasting
      the next time period’s correlation.

      <h1>Free/Open Source Software Adoption, Public Policies and Development Indicators: An International Comparison</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      Despite the growing body of research on the inner workings of
      FOSS development, there are few studies on its relation with
      broader developments in society. In this study we have attempted
      a preliminary investigation of (1) how FOSS prevalence is
      related to economic and human development indicators of
      countries, (2) whether public policies regarding FOSS emerge in
      a consistent relation with these indicators in several clusters
      of countries constructed from the United Nation’s human
      development index, and (3) the relation of software piracy to
      development indicators. Our results point to relative
      significance of non-economic factors in FOSS adoption, lack of
      consistent policies among public agencies, and irrelevance of
      non-economic factors on software piracy. In addition, the study
      demonstrates the possibility of developing FOSS indices for
      larger scale diagnosis and strategizing.

      <h1>Organization of Internet Standards</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      In this study we look at a body of standards documents in
      RFCs(Request For Comments) of IETF (Internet Engineering Task
      Force). The cross references between these documents form a
      network. Approaches from social network analysis are deployed to
      assess centrality of artifacts in this network and identify
      cohesive subgroups and levels of cohesion. Our results
      demonstrate major groups centered around key standard tracks,
      and application of network metrics reflect different levels of
      cohesion for these groups. As application of these techniques in
      such domains is unusual, possible uses in open source projects
      for strategizing are discussed.

      <h1>CL-SNA: Social network analysis with Lisp</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      Social relations have been a research interest in many areas of
      social sciences. In sociology, for example, individuals up in
      the power hierarchy in a group can be determined quantitatively
      by looking at the number of direct relations to others in the
      group[1]. Similarly, in management and economics, alliance
      relationships between firms are examined carefully to explain
      phenomenon such as innovation and market leadership[6]. Similar
      problems were encountered in Anthropology, Zoology, and many
      other fields. In most studies regarding social relations, one
      must look into the content of social relations in addition to
      their structure, an endeavor which demands ethnographic
      methods. Nevertheless, analysis of the structure alone has been
      a powerful tool which not only enables quantitative assessment
      of social structures, but also prompts elaboration of
      interpretive process.

      <h1>Public Policies in the Software Market: Regional Issues Concerning Open Source Software</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      A topic recently discussed in the literature about software
      markets concerns government policies supporting open-source
      software, the purpose of such an intervention being the
      prevention of failures in that market and ultimately increase
      social welfare. Possible interventions include mandated adoption
      and information campaigns. Our study investigates the
      relationship between FOSS (free and open source software)
      prevalence on the one hand, and economic and human development
      indicators on the other, across about 130 countries. We find
      that FOSS prevalence is related to education rather than to
      economic well-being, which is largely in line with findings
      reported in the scientific literature obtained using approaches
      different from ours. Furthermore, clustering our sample of
      countries with respect to several indicators permits insight
      into how governments have already implemented policies in public
      agencies, and leads to suggestions about possible future
      policies.

      <h1>The Ghost in the Machine: Cognitive Patterns in Open Source Software Communities</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      Innovation capacity of open source software communities has
      received increasing interest from management researchers. In
      this study we have looked into cognitive processes in these
      communities by analysing peer communication in expert and novice
      groups of two open source project communities. Our results
      underline certain cognitive and behavioral patterns pertaining
      to these communities: (1) actively and reciprocally sharing
      information for collective problem solving, (2) inclusive
      attitudes for community enlargement and for possible progression
      of users to being developers, and (3) natural, rather than
      centrally managed, team formation informed by individual’s
      success in articulation of community values.

      <h1>Flexible organizing and identity fragmentation in Free/Open Source Software development</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      Free/Open Source Software(FOSS) development is regarded as one
      of the most noteworthy contemporary collective innovation
      processes. Software produced in FOSS projects are available to
      everyone for all sorts of use and modification, only with some
      restrictions on how the modified versions can be licensed. This
      enables developer groups to start a new development branch for
      their own needs by choosing to develop separately from the
      parent project, which is called ‘forking’. In this study, we
      have examined the histories of several project forks in FOSS. We
      have approached fragmentation of FOSS community and group
      identities through forking as a technology for problem solving
      and distributed innovation, attempted to identify factors that
      this fragmentation is contingent upon and understand
      construction of identities during the fork. Social power
      struggles, differences in interest, mobility and licensing terms
      were found to be the major reasons which trigger forking
      decisions. The variety of forking situations we have examined
      exhibits two levels of positioning with other
      actors(individuals, cliques, projects) in order to construct
      their identities: (1) higher distance with some actors for
      maintaining specialization, independence or competitive
      advantage, and (2) closer distance for maintaining compatibility
      and reciprocal benefit with some others. Norms and values in
      FOSS community level, which are partly reflected in license
      terms, serve as the constitutional basis which maintain
      coherence of this system through the fragmentation process.

      <h1>Currency carry trading with MGARCH-based carry-to-risk portfolio optimization</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      Currency carry trading is an investment strategy which borrows
      in a low-yield currency and/or invests in a high-yield currency,
      with the hope of profiting from the interest rate differential
      (the carry) between two money markets, as well as from currency
      movements.  Technically, profit (or loss) will be generated by a
      difference between the exchange rate written in a forward
      contract, and the spot exchange rate on the day when the
      contract expires. The risk in this strategy stems from
      unforeseeable currency movements. Which currencies, and with
      which weights, should be included in a portfolio? One possible
      approach is to use carry-to-risk maximization. We extend the
      usual static approach by substituting an MGARCH-based
      conditional covariance matrix capable of forecasting portfolio
      risk for the next period. By comparing examples of time series
      of realized profits, our paper shows the benefit of forecasting
      the conditional covariance structure of currency movements when
      constructing a carry-trading portfolio.

      <h1>mgarch: A Package for the Analysis of Multivariate GARCH Models</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      In recent years, conditional heteroskedasticity (CH) models have
      become the workhorse in the study of returns on assets, their
      purpose being in particular to provide insight into the impact
      of news on the volatility of asset returns.  However, little
      free software is available for the analysis, in terms of CH
      models, of multivariate time series. We present a package which
      tries to make a contribution in this direction. Our package
      provides elementary functionality to build a synchronized
      multivariate time series of daily or weekly returns, on the
      basis of separate univariate level series, which need not be in
      sync (i.e., different days may be missing). The main part of the
      package consists of functions which permit the estimation of
      MGARCH-BEKK and related models, among them a novel bivariate
      asymmetric model which is capable of distinguishing between
      positive and negative returns. Diagnostic tools are also
      included.
