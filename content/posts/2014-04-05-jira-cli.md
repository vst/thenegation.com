We are using Atlassian JIRA On Demand. It is very slow and becomes
very annoying when trying to organize multiple projects. For now, I
decided to use a command line application,
[jira-cli](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jira-cli) to quickly check my
issues on JIRA. Here is how I utilize it using my *bash*
configuration.

It works better by adding the following to `.bash_profile` (you need
to install *csvlook*):

    function vst-jira-mine {
        test -n "$1" && PROJECT="project='${1}' AND "

        jira-cli \
            --oneline \
            -f '%project|%key|%status|%priority|%summary' \
            --search-jql="${PROJECT}assignee=currentUser() AND resolution=Unresolved ORDER BY priority DESC, updatedDate DESC" \
            | csvlook -d '|' -H
    }

To list all my issues sorted according to priority and update date, I
use:

    vst-jira-mine

and to list the same limited to a particular project:

    vst-jira-mine PROJECT-CODE

It works, for now...
