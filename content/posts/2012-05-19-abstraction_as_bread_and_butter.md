I find first pages of a book as the most instructive ones for many
reasons. When I look into a good book which I've read many years ago,
I still find those first pages more interesting and inspiring.

Recently, I started reading a new book: "A Book of Abstract
Algebra". Similarly, I found a very interesting statement in the
introductory chapter:

It is, indeed. Obviously, there is a lot to think on the abstraction
of abstraction.
