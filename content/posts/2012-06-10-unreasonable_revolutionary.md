["How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method"](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192221.How_to_Solve_It)
by [George Pólya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P%C3%B3lya)
provides a detailed and entertaining survey of general methods for
problem solving, namely *Heuristics*. I guess that most people dealing
with mathematics in daily life have read this book.

Recently, I came across with
["How to Solve It: Modern Heuristics"](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/633240.How_to_Solve_It). This
book, like its *predecessor*, is about problem solving, but it focuses
on computational methodologies to problem solving. There are many
beautiful comments on the book around the Internet. Although its name
implies that Pólya's concept of heuristic is traditional and this book
introduces a modern one, I think that both are modern in essence and
complement each other from a daily practitioner's point of view (I'd
name the book as "How to Solve It: Contemporary Heuristics" or "How to
Solve It: Computational Heuristics"). Anyways, it will be a lot fun to
read it.

I am especially delighted when I read the introductory chapter.  Below
is a quote from
[George Bernard Shaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw)
which is given at the beginning of the very first chapter:

> The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable
> one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore
> all progress depends on the unreasonable man.
>
> -- George Bernard Shaw, Maxims for Revolutionists.

An interesting man, George Bernard Shaw... I like his humour: He is
provocative, yet gentle. When I read his views on Islam and the
transcript of the meeting of him with Maulana Abdul Aleem Siddiqui, I
was so sad about why I was not introduced to his writings
before. Maybe, I should have read "How to Solve It: Modern Heuristics"
earlier.

Well, it is not too late to read both...
