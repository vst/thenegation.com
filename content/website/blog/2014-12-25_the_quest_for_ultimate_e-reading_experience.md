What is the ultimate experience of managing and reading e-books across
various devices we use? This article is a summary of my quest in this
direction.

## The Past and Our Betrayal

Our ancestors have been traveling for months just to be able to read
a book or a few pages remaining from it. To Alexandria, Baghdad,
Samarkand... From all around the known world then. Now, looking in
what has 21st century technology has brought to us, I feel that we are
betraying our ancestors by proving how we read lesser and lesser
despite the convenience which we have now.

Not to mention how cheap books are nowadays, e-book technology made it
even a lot more convenient (and cheaper) to read. However, there are
still actors which are trying to make it as difficult as possible just
for the sake of more profits. And I have doubts if they achieve this
objective.

## My Sources for E-books

Let me summarize first where I obtain my e-books from:

0. [Amazon Kindle](www.amazon.com/Kindle-Store/b?node=133140011)
0. [O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/category/ebooks.do)
0. [Mannings Books](www.manning.com)
0. [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/)
0. [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/)
0. [Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page)
0. [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/shop)
0. [Delphi Classics](http://www.delphiclassics.com/)
0. And many other sources for various content...

Contents from these sources are delivered usually in epub/mobi and
sometimes in PDF format. The problem is that most of the content is
DRM-free, but unfortunately, some publishers and shops still deliver
e-books with DRM protection.

## The Problem

The big boss here is the Amazon. All the content is DRM-protected and
cannot be read in e-book readers and software which are not coming
from Amazon. Good news is that Kindle e-book reader can store and view
normal epub files which we can obtain anywhere else.

I haven't mentioned the other big boss in the list above. It's Adobe
Digital Editions (ADE) and its friends. ADE uses DRM-protected epub
format and it cannot be read through a Kindle device as it does not
have ADE installed.

Can I stick to Kindle only? Nope! Amazon does not offer some of the
books which I want to read, especially Turkish books. Idefix, one of
the biggest Turkish online (e)book retailers, has a very good
collection of e-books, but then I need to forget about Kindle. All the
other restrictions are extra burden, too: Cannot store and read the
e-book in more than X devices etc...

By the way, my Macbook and iOS devices do not have a Kindle software
as Kindle content is not available in Singapore, hence the device and
software officially from the App Store. Kindle for Mac is no longer
available through download option anymore.

## Calibre: The Ultimate Solution (Definitely Not)

Even if I would buy ebooks without any worries from any publisher,
strip the DRM protection (some people think it is a *just* action, but
seems to be illegal), and use the open-source e-book management and
reading software [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/), it is
definitely not convenient as it sounds:

1. How to synchronize across different devices
2. How to bear with the ugly interface (Reading is impossible)
3. Time spent for importing/exporting (and De-DRMing if it were not illegal)

## I wish...

... that

1. All publishers would provide both print and e-book versions of the books,
2. DRM would be abolished,
3. No e-shop would introduce any further restrictions on how we manage and read our books,
4. All free and open source software would look and operate nicely as most Apple software,
5. I could put my e-book library to a cloud storage system,
6. I could use my Macbook, iPad, iPhone, Kindle, Raspberry Pi and Ubuntu Machine to access my e-book library,
7. I could choose the book which I want to read from my e-book library and open it,
8. My e-book would be visualized nicely with good typography which I can fine-tune according to my physical condition and my taste,
9. All annotations and my reading history would be synchronized back to my library in the cloud, and most importantly,
9. I would enjoy reading!

## Current situation

I am currently using Calibre to manage my e-book library. Books which
are not in my Kindle device but I want to read are sent to my Kindle
or synchronized to iBooks (for my iPad and iPhone), all manually. All
reading experience is encapsulated in the device which I am reading
the content from, ie. it is not synchronized.

## Future

It seems that there is no way to get rid off DRM. And I have to stick
to Kindle Store and must somehow engage with Idefix (or another
retailer).

Until anything changes, I will stick to Calibre to manage my e-book
library and use multiple devices with multiple software for reading
the books which I will manually keep syncing. Hope that iCloud helps.

Will keep you updated.
